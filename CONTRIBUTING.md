# MERITS

(Metaresearch Evaluation Repository to Identify Trustworthy Science)

### Vision statement

We're building a tool to help people find ratings that researchers have given to articles so that we can improve their visibility, support meta-research and foster innovation in the scholarly evaluation space. Watch [this quick introduction](https://youtu.be/_ee4ESnzI40) to learn more.

### Welcome!

Thanks for dropping by to our open source project! This project is being led by Cooper Smout and Dawn Holford, with support from a passionate team of volunteer contributors (see Credits in the [Readme](https://github.com/Innovation-Sprint-2021/MERITS/blob/main/README.md)). We hope that you will consider contributing too!

Please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Innovation-Sprint-2021/MERITS/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing and see our [Readme](https://github.com/Innovation-Sprint-2021/MERITS/blob/main/README.md) and Roadmap to find out more about the project. 

### Communication channels
